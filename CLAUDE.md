## PM Conductor — operating rules

This repo is managed by the `pm` plugin. The conductor sits ABOVE OpenSpec and Superpowers.
Epics are **lane-agnostic** (openspec | superpowers | claude-code | decision | external);
OpenSpec is one lane. Stories come from each epic's source (OpenSpec `tasks.md`, a Superpowers
plan, or a manual list). Follow these rules:

1. **Detours** — when something blocks the active epic, CLASSIFY before fixing:
   - *Minimal* (small, self-contained, no design ambiguity): fix → test → commit → push,
     then run `/pm:detour --minimal "<what>"` so it is recorded in `.conductor/detours.log`.
     Then resume.
   - *Substantial* (own design / changes shared behavior / multi-step): run `/pm:detour`.
     It becomes its own epic in the appropriate lane (OpenSpec proposal, Superpowers plan,
     etc.); PUSH the current epic onto the detour stack in `.conductor/state.json` with a
     concrete reason and `reconcileOnResume`.
2. **State of record is `.conductor/state.json`.** After any change to epics, status,
   priority, or the detour stack, re-render with `/pm:status`. Never hand-edit `PROJECT.md`.
3. **Resuming after a detour** — use `/pm:resume`. If the popped frame had
   `reconcileOnResume`, run the reconcile gate (reconciler agent) BEFORE writing code.
4. **Honcho** — on every PUSH and POP, also write a one-line memory to Honcho
   ("paused X for Y" / "resumed X, reconciled vs Y") so the relationship survives outside
   this repo.
5. **Keep `tasks.md` checkboxes truthful** — they are the source of truth for story progress.
6. **Roadmap as backlog** — work you intend to do but haven't proposed yet can be
   registered now with `/pm:epic add … --status planned` (any lane). Planned epics show
   as ordered backlog in `PROJECT.md` and a `planned: N` count in the briefing, without a
   "no change on disk" warning; `/pm:sync` flips an openspec planned epic to untriaged once
   its change is proposed. Have a roadmap doc? Read it in-session and load each item this way.

## Epic-level autonomy

An epic's `autonomy` block (`.conductor/state.json`) can grant it broad execution trust —
`level: "off"` by default (today's behavior, unchanged). Setting `level: "autonomous"`
removes the need to ask before each phase transition, but NEVER removes a genuine safety stop.
This is development-time only — it never covers actions with irreversible EXTERNAL side
effects (sending email/Slack, deploying to production, third-party API calls, pushing to a
shared branch); those are out of scope regardless of autonomy level.

1. **Preflight before flipping the switch** — see the `conductor` skill's
   "Epic-level autonomy — the preflight scan" section for the full process. In short: read
   the epic's full source, produce a short batch of destructive-risk-points +
   genuine-unknowns questions, get the user's answers, THEN record them:
   `set-autonomy <id> --preauthorize "<action>:<reason>"` / `--context "<note>"`, and only
   then `set-autonomy <id> --level autonomous`.
2. **Execution-time decision rule** — check every destructive action against these, in
   order, before treating it as a stop:
   a. Already pre-authorized in the preflight? → proceed, record via `--notify`.
   b. No backup/restore path exists? → STOP regardless of autonomy level.
   c. Destructive but restorable (backed up first)? → WARN — log it, proceed.
   d. No context to act on? → STOP — a real gap, not a false stall.
   e. Consequential and not yet notified? → record it for the end-of-epic report.
3. **End-of-epic report** — on completion, report what was asked, what was done, decisions
   made in the user's absence (the WARN-class log), and an explicit "are you OK with
   these?" checkpoint, THEN run tests. Leave room to iterate — including rewriting code —
   if the user is not satisfied.

## Review mode

Review intensity is a bounded dial, not a free-form call each time — set via
`set-review-mode --mode <off|standard|thorough>` (default: `standard` if never set).

| Mode | Reviewer budget | Trigger |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `off` | none — self-review only | tiny, low-risk, single-file claude-code tweaks |
| `standard` | one fresh-context reviewer per gate | the default: OpenSpec Gate 1/Gate 2, a Superpowers task review |
| `thorough` | two independent fresh-context reviewers per gate; adjudicate any disagreement yourself | schema/migration changes, security-sensitive work, or anything explicitly flagged high-stakes |

Current mode: **standard**.
